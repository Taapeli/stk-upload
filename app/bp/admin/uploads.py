#===============================================================================
# Background loading of a Gramps XML file
# 
# 1. The user uploads an XML file using the user interface. This is handled by the function "upload_gramps". 
#    The file is stored in the user specific folder uploads/<username>. A log file with the name <xml-file>.log
#    is created automatically (where <xml-file> is the name of the uploaded file.
# 
# 2. The upload_gramps function redirects to "list_uploads" which shows the XML files uploaded by this user. 
#
# 3. The admin user can see all users' uploads by going to the user list screen and clicking the link 'uploads' or via the
#    link "show all uploads"
#
# 4. The admin user sees a list of the uploaded files for a user but he also sees more information and is able to initiate
#    loading of the file into the Neo4j database. This will call the function "initiate_background_load_to_neo4j"
# 
# 5. The function "initiate_background_load_to_neo4j" starts a background thread to do the actual database load. 
#    The thread executes the function "background_load_to_neo4j" which calls the actual logic in
#    "gramps_loader.xml_to_neo4j"
#    
#    The folder "uploads/<userid>" also contains a "metadata" file "<xml-file>.meta" for status information. 
#    This file contains a text form of a dictionary with keys "status" and "upload_time".
#
#    The status is initially set to "uploaded" while the file has been uploaded by the user. 
#    When the load to the database is ongoing the status is "loading". After successful database load 
#    the status is set to "done" (these values are mapped to different words in the user interface).
#
#    If an exception occurs during the database load then the status is set to "failed".
#    
# 6. It is conceivable that the thread doing the load is somehow stopped without being able to rename the file
#    to indicate a completion or failure. Then the status remains "loading" indefinitely. 
#    This situation is noticed by the "i_am_alive" thread whose only purpose is to update the timestamp of
#    ("touch") the log file as long as the loading thread is running. This update will happen every 10 seconds.
#
#    This enables the user interface to notice that the load has failed. The status will be set to "error"
#    if the log file is not updated (touched) for a minute.
#
# 7. If the load completes successfully then the status is set to "done". The result of the load is 
#    returned by the "xml_to_neo4j" function as a list of Log records. 
#    This list is stored in text format in the log file.
#    The user interface is then able to retrieve the Log records and display them to the user (in function
#    upload_info).
#
# 8. The "uploads" function displays a list of the load operations performed by the user. This function 
#    will display the state of the file. The list is automatically updated every 30 seconds.
# 
#    The user is redirected to this screen immediately after initiating a load operation. The user can also 
#    go to the screen from the main display.
