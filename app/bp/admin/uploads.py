# ===============================================================================
# Background loading of a Gramps XML file
#
# 1. The user uploads an XML file using the user interface. This is handled by
#    the function "upload_gramps". The file is stored in the user specific folder
#    uploads/<username>. A log file with the name <xml-file>.log is created
#    automatically (where <xml-file> is the name of the uploaded file.
#
# 2. The upload_gramps function redirects to "list_uploads" which shows the XML
#    files uploaded by this user.
#
# 3. The admin user can see all users' uploads by going to the user list screen
#    and clicking the link 'uploads' or via the link "show all uploads".
#
# 4. The admin user sees a list of the uploaded files for a user but he also sees
#    more information and is able to initiate loading of the file into the Neo4j
#    database called "stkbase". This will call the function
#    "initiate_background_load_to_stkbase".
#
# 5. The function "initiate_background_load_to_stkbase" starts a background
#    thread to do the actual database load. The thread executes the function
#    "background_load_to_stkbase" which calls the actual logic in
#    "gramps_loader.xml_to_stkbase".
#
#    The folder "uploads/<userid>" also contains a "metadata" file
#    "<xml-file>.meta" for status information. This file contains a text form
#    of a dictionary with keys "status" and "upload_time".
#
#    The status is initially set to "uploaded" while the file has been uploaded
#    by the user. When the load to the database is ongoing the status is
#    "loading". After successful database load the status is set to "done"
#    (these values are mapped to different words in the user interface).
#
#    If an exception occurs during the database load then the status is set to
#    "failed".
#
# 6. It is conceivable that the thread doing the load is somehow stopped
#    without being able to rename the file to indicate a completion or failure.
#    Then the status remains "loading" indefinitely. This situation is noticed
#    by the "i_am_alive" thread whose only purpose is to update the timestamp of
#    ("touch") the log file as long as the loading thread is running. This
#    update will happen every 10 seconds.
#
#    This enables the user interface to notice that the load has failed. The
#    status will be set to "error" if the log file is not updated (touched)
#    for a minute.
#
# 7. If the load completes successfully then the status is set to "done". The
#    result of the load is returned by the "xml_to_stkbase" function as a
#    list of Log records. This list is stored in text format in the log file.
#    The user interface is then able to retrieve the Log records and display
#    them to the user (in function upload_info).
#
# 8. The "uploads" function displays a list of the load operations performed by
#    the user. This function will display the state of the file. The list is
#    automatically updated every 30 seconds.
#
#    Note. For easier Gramps upload testing you may set 'USE_I_AM_ALIVE = False'
#          in instance/config.py, which reduces console output.
#
#    The user is redirected to this screen immediately after initiating a load
#    operation. The user can also go to the screen from the main display.
