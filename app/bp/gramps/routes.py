#===============================================================================
# Background loading of a Gramps XML file
# 
# 1. The user uploads an XML file using the user interface. This is handled by the function "upload_gramps". 
#    The file is stored in a global temporary folder (e.g. /tmp).
# 
# 2. The function redirects to "save_loaded_gramps" which calls "initiate_background_load_to_neo4j"
# 
# 3. The function "initiate_background_load_to_neo4j" starts a background thread to do the actual database load. 
#    The thread executes the function "background_load_to_neo4j" which calls the actual logic in
#    "gramps_loader.xml_to_neo4j"
#    
#    For each user there is the folder "uploads/<userid>" that contains "log files" for the loads
#    performed by the user. These log files are also used to keep track of the loading progress
#    as described below.
#    
#    The function "initiate_background_load_to_neo4j" generates a unique file name for the log file.
#    This file in the upload folder serves as a marker while the load is running and finally contains the log
#    data for the load. The file name consists of three parts:
# 
#    <timestamp>.<xml-file>.<state>
#    
#    <timestamp> is the time when the load started (as seconds returned by the time.time() function - only
#    the integer part is retained).
#    
#    <xml-file> is the name of the file being loaded to the database (.xml or .gramps).
#    
#    The suffix <state> is one of
#    
#    - loading
#    - loading.done
#    - loading.failed
#    
#    The suffix is initially "loading" and remains so while the Neo4j load is being processed. If the load 
#    completes successfully then ".done" is appended to the file name (i.e. the file is renamed). 
#    If there is an error (an exception is thrown) then ".failed" is appended.
#    
# 4. It is conceivable that the thread doing the load is somehow stopped without being able to rename the file
#    to indicate a completion or failure. Then the file name suffix remains ".loading" indefinitely. 
#    This situation is noticed by the "i_am_alive" thread whose only purpose is to update the timestamp of
#    ("touch") the log file as long as the loading thread is running. This update will happen every 10 seconds.
#    
#    This enables the user interface to notice that the load has failed. The load will be marked as "in error"
#    if the log file is not updated (touched) for a minute.
#    
# 5. If the load completes successfully then the file is renamed with a ".done" suffix as explained above.
#    The result of the load is also stored in the file. The result is returned by the "xml_to_neo4j" function
#    as a list of Log recerds. This list is serialized using the "pickle" module and stored in the file.
#    THe user interface is then able to retrieve the Log records and display them to the user (in function
#    upload_info).
#    
# 6. The "uploads" function displays a list of the load operations performed by the user. This function 
#    will display the state of the file according to the file name suffix and also indicates an error if the
#    file is "loading" but has not been updated for minute. The list is automatically updated every 30 seconds.
# 
#    The user is redirected to this screen immediately after initiating a load operation. The user can also 
#    go to the screen from the main display.
